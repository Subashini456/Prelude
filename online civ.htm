<p><br><font color="white">Acoustics is the science of sound and someone who studies acoustics is called an acoustician.
There are many kinds of sound and many ways that sound affects our lives. For example, we use sound to talk and sound is important for designing musical instruments, concert halls, surround sound stereo and hearing aids<a href="https://exploresound.org/explore-sound-home/what-is-acoustics/">continue to read....</font></a></p>

<p><br><font color="white">Remote sensing observations provide data on earth's natural resources in a spatial format. The remote sensing (RS) data has the advantage of synoptic view and large area coverage. The information required in the field of civil engineering is derived mainly from analysis of image patterns present in the data.<a href="http://www.buildnova.com/buildnovav3/articles/htmlfiles/an_overview_of_remote1.htm">continue to read....</font></a></p>

<img src="Natural_haz.jpg" alt="img" width="270" height="200" align="left">
<p><br><font color="white">A natural hazard is a natural phenomenon that might have a negative effect on humans or the environment. Natural hazard events can be classified into two broad categories:geophysical and biological. Geophysical hazards encompass geological and meteorological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, cyclonic storms, floods, droughts, avalanches and landslides. Biological hazards can refer to a diverse array of disease, infection, infestation and invasive species. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hazard">continue to read....</font></a></p>
